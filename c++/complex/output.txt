type two doubles for c11: c1 = 0

c2 = 1.2 + 4.9i

c3 = 2.2 + i

c4 = -7 + 9.6i

c5 = 8.1 - 4.3i

c6 = -7.1i

c7 = 6.4

c8 = i

c9 = 4.1i

c10 = -i

c11 = 2 + 0.1i

c1 + c2 + c3 = 3.4 + 5.9i

c7 - c8 - c9= 6.4 - 5.1i

c2 * 22 = 26.4 + 107.8i

c2 * c3 = -2.26 + 11.98i

c2 / c3 = 1.2911 + 1.64041i

c2 / c1 = This is an error, original value is: 1.2 + 4.9i

 c2 / c5 = -0.134958 + 0.533294i

c4 == c4 is true
c4 != c4 is false
Conjugate of8.1 - 4.3i
 is 8.1 + 4.3i

Real of2.2 + i
 is 2.2
Imaginary of-7 + 9.6i
 is 9.6
(c5 += c2) += c3 is 11.5 + 1.6i

(c5 -= c1) -= c2 is 10.3 - 3.3i

(c5 *= 22) *= 13 is 2945.8 - 943.8i

(c5 *= c4) *= c4 is -253987 - 355181i

(c3 /= 2) / c3 is 1

c4 is -7 + 9.6i

(c4 /= c1) / c1 is This is an error, original value is 
This is an error, original value is: -7 + 9.6i

c4 is -7 + 9.6i
